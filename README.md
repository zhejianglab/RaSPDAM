# RaSPDAM

## Introduction
**RaSPDAM** (**Ra**dio **S**ingle-**P**ulse **D**etection **A**lgorithm Based on Visual **M**orphological Features) is a novel machine learning algorithm specifically designed for the detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Developed to address the computational and time challenges associated with traditional FRB search methods, RaSPDAM offers significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy.

## Background
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are brief, intense pulses of radio energy originating from distant galaxies. Their discovery and study are crucial for understanding the distribution and evolution of matter in the universe. However, the detection of FRBs is a challenging task due to the vast amounts of data produced by radio telescopes and the computational complexity of existing search methods. Traditional techniques often struggle with detecting weak signals and are time-consuming.

## Methodology
### Pre-processing

The preprocessing pipeline begins by converting the original signal sequence into standardized images without de-dispersion, where the sequence is divided into smaller slices using a 2-second sliding window with a 1-second overlap. These image slices are then resized to 512 Ã— 512 pixels to standardize the model input. To enhance signal characteristics, particularly the typical curve of the FRB signal amidst noise, convolution is applied using multiple kernels generated from fixed curve slopes, transforming the image by processing each pixel and its local neighbors. After this, morphological dilation further enhances the signal. Finally, the enhanced images are combined with the original image to form an RGB image, which serves as the model input, as illustrated in Figure 1.

### Pulse searching

RaSPDAM utilizes a U-Net architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image segmentation tasks. This U-Net model comprises an encoder that extracts slope-based features from the input image and a decoder that reconstructs the image using these features. Despite this process, some noise may still remain in the output, so we apply additional filtering steps to identify potential FRB signals. Using the "regionprops" function, we analyze connected regions in the segmented image and calculate each candidate's projections on the x- and y-axes. Candidates exceeding defined thresholds on both axes are flagged as potential FRB signals.

## Dataset
The testing of RaSPDAM is facilitated by the **FAST-FREX** dataset, which is built upon observations obtained by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The dataset consists of:

- 600 positive samples: Observed FRB signals from three sources (FRB20121102, FRB20180301, and FRB20201124).
- 1000 negative samples: Noise and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).

## Key Features
### Efficiency and Accuracy
- High Precision: RaSPDAM achieves a precision of 98.73%, significantly outperforming traditional methods like PRESTO and Heimdall.
- High Recall: With a recall rate of 77.67%, RaSPDAM effectively identifies a large proportion of true FRB signals.
- F1 Score: An F1 score of 0.8694 indicates a well-balanced trade-off between precision and recall.
### Versatility
- ToA and DM: While RaSPDAM currently provides Time of Arrival (ToA) as a result, future enhancements aim to include Dispersion Measure (DM) for more comprehensive signal verification.
